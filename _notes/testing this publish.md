I will attempt to link to the squash note: [lemme trying renaming this](./squash.md).

Does that work? Does this work?
Linking with obsidian link only: [sanfoora](./sanfoora.md)
Linking with title: [Sanfoora on the websitee](Sanfoora%20on%20the%20websitee.md)
Linking with filename: [sanfoora](sanfoora.md)

Link to something with same filename and title: [installnode](./installnode.md)
