title: Some thoughts on daily standups
---
I have been thinking about standups and such... what is the point of them it seems they just waste everyone's time...

Everyone does them though so there must be some kind of point. Around a year ago I set out to investigate this and figure out what the benefits of standups were. I tried to find every positive attribute I could.

The more I looked and thought about it the more I realised that maybe this entire thing is useless?

What held me back from arriving at this conclusion was that I was giving standups too much credit and respect. Sometimes you just have to trust your instincts.

Do not give respect that which has not earned it. You don't earn respect by being popular and well known. You have to have some substance behind it.

Standups have nothing.
