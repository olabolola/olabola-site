title: Don’t give them a chance to object

If you want something to move forwards and you don't really need a response from someone but you need to let them know nonetheless, then it's best to phrase your message such that you can move forward even if they do not reply to you.

An important thing to keep in mind is "opportunities for intervention". Sometimes you want to give people opportunities to intervene. For example, if you are the game master for some RPG your situations should always have many opportunities for your players to intervene and have agency in the world.

However, if you are in a work environment and are reasonably confident in your work then it's ok to allow people to intervene but allow yourself to move forwards even if you don't hear back.

In the following "Less Good" examples, you are making it the default position of others to intervene. In the "More Good" examples, they can still intervene, but they must have the intention and will to do it.

**Less Good**
> Just completed the architecture design. Please review it and let me know if it’s okay to proceed.

**More Good**
> Just completed the architecture design. I’ll proceed with the next steps unless I hear any objections by [specific time/date].

**Less Good**
> Finished the budget report. Do you think it's ready to be shared with the team?

**More Good**
> Finished the budget report. I'll plan to share it with the team tomorrow. Let me know if you have any changes by then.

**Less Good:**

> Completed the client presentation slides. Should I schedule a meeting with the client?

**More Good:**

> Completed the client presentation slides. I’ll go ahead and schedule a meeting with the client for next week. Let me know if you have any concerns.

**Less Good:**

> I’ve fixed the bug in the system. Do you want me to deploy it now?

**More Good:**

> I’ve fixed the bug in the system. I’ll deploy the fix in the next hour. Let me know if you need any further adjustments.

**Less Good:**

> I’ve created the project timeline. Is it okay to send it to the stakeholders?

**More Good:**

> I’ve created the project timeline. Planning to send it to the stakeholders by end of day. Please reach out if there are any issues.
