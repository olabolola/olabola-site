title: My thoughts on LLMs
created: 2024-12-26

These are just my current thoughts. Will be updated based on future evidence and experience.

- LLMs are very useful tools *especially* for coding. They have saved me so much time and allowed me to do things I would never have otherwise done.
	- Therefore, I am immediately suspicious of anyone who says LLMs are "useless".
- Software Engineering is going nowhere.
	- Everyone wants to say that LLMs will replace software engineers. This seems to be obviously false.
	- If you have ever used LLMs in an established legacy codebase you know how useless it can be.
	- One way jobs may be lost is through the *perception* that LLMs decrease the need for engineers. Therefore, engineers may be laid off.
		- However, this is a matter of perception not of reality. You *can* get rid of engineers the same way you *can* get rid of chairs and get people to hover in place.
	- LLMs *may* reach a point where they can replace software engineers. But so far we are not close.
	- Due to all this I am immediately suspicious of anyone who talks about LLMs replacing humans, especially software engineers.
- The LLM threat is its use by humans, not the LLM itself.
	- We are not close to LLMs gaining "consciousness" and killing humans.
	- We are close to humans using LLMs to incite revolutions in countries. To inciting people to murder. Spreading lies which cause deaths.
		- All of this has probably already happened and will continue to happen.
